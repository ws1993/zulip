    This table essentially functions as a generic foreign key that

    the audience for a message, while supporting the different types
    of audiences Zulip supports for a message.

    Recipient has just two attributes: The enum type, and a type_id,
    which is the ID of the UserProfile/Stream/DirectMessageGroup object
    containing all the metadata for the audience. There are 3 recipient
    types:

    1. 1:1 direct message: The type_id is the ID of the UserProfile
       who will receive any message to this Recipient. The sender
       of such a message is represented separately.
    2. Stream message: The type_id is the ID of the associated Stream.
    3. Group direct message: In Zulip, group direct messages are
       represented by DirectMessageGroup objects, which encode the set of
       users in the conversation. The type_id is the ID of the associated
       DirectMessageGroup object; the set of users is usually retrieved
       via the Subscription table. See the DirectMessageGroup model for
       details.

    See also the Subscription model, which stores which UserProfile
    objects are subscribed to which Recipient objects.
