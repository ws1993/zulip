1. Go to the **Settings** page of your Front organization, and select
   the **App store** tab. Search for the **Webhooks** integration that's
   published by Front, and enable the app.

1. Select the **Rules** tab, and add a new shared rule. Set the **When**
   and **If** conditions you would like to be notified about. Set **Send
   to a Webhook** as the action, and input the URL generated above in
   the **Target Webhook** field. Click **Save**.

1. [Add a new linkifier](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) in your Zulip
   organization. Set the pattern to `cnv_(?P<id>[0-9a-z]+)` and the URL
   template to `https://app.frontapp.com/open/cnv_{id}`. This step maps
   Front conversations to topics in Zulip.
