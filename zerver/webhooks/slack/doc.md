# Forward Slack messages into Zulip

Forward messages sent to your Slack workspace's public channels into Zulip!

This integration lets you choose how to organize your Slack messages in Zulip.
You can:

- Send messages from each Slack channel into a **matching Zulip channel**.
- Send messages from each Slack channel into a **matching Zulip topic**.
- Send all Slack messages into a **single Zulip topic**.

If you'd like to forward messages in both directions (Slack to Zulip and Zulip
to Slack), please see [separate instructions][6] for how to set this up.

If you are looking to quickly move your Slack integrations to Zulip, check out
[Zulip's Slack-compatible incoming webhook][1].

    Using [Slack's legacy Outgoing Webhook service][5] is no longer
    recommended. Follow these instructions to switch to the new
    [Slack Events API][3].

    To send messages from each Slack channel into a **matching Zulip channel**,
    enable the **Send all notifications to a single topic** option, and add
    `&channels_map_to_topics=0` to the generated URL. For each public channel in
    your Slack workspace, be sure to [create][2] a Zulip channel with the same
    name.

    To send messages from each Slack channel into a **matching Zulip topic**,
    disable the **Send all notifications to a single topic** option when
    generating the URL. Add `&channels_map_to_topics=1` to the generated URL.

    To send all Slack messages into a **single Zulip topic**, enable the **Send
    all notifications to a single topic** option, with no further modifications.

1. *(optional)* If you're setting up a [Slack bridge][6] to forward Zulip messages
   into your Slack workspace, replace the value of the `?api_key=` parameter in
   the **integration URL** you generated with the API key of the **Generic bot**
   you're using for the Slack bridge.

1. Create a new [Slack app][4], and open it. Navigate to the **OAuth
   & Permissions** menu, and scroll down to the **Scopes** section.

1. Make sure **Bot Token Scopes** includes `channels:read`,
   `channels:history`, `emoji:read`, `team:read`, `users:read`, and
   `users:read.email`.

    !!! tip ""

        See [Slack's Events API documentation][3] for details about
        these scopes.

1. Scroll to the **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** section in the
   same menu, and click **Install to Workspace**.

1. Copy the Slack **Bot User OAuth Token**, and add it to the end of your
   **integration URL** as `&slack_app_token=BOT_OAUTH_TOKEN`.

1. Go to the **Event Subscriptions** menu, toggle **Enable Events**, and enter
   your updated **integration URL** in the **Request URL** field.

1. In the same menu, scroll down to the **Subscribe to bot events**
   section, and click on **Add Bot User Event**. Select the
   `message.channels` event.
