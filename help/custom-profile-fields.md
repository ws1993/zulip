# Custom profile fields

{!admin-only.md!}

[User cards](/help/user-cards) show basic information about a user, and [user
profiles](/help/view-someones-profile) provide additional details. You can add
custom profile fields to user cards and user profiles, making it easy for users
to share information, such as their pronouns, job title, or team.

Zulip supports many types of profile fields, such as dates, lists of options,
GitHub account links, and [more](#profile-field-types). You can choose which
custom profile fields to [display](#display-custom-fields-on-user-card) on user
cards. Custom profile fields can be optional or
[required](#make-a-custom-profile-field-required).

Zulip supports synchronizing custom profile fields from an external
user database such as LDAP or SAML. See the [authentication
methods][authentication-production] documentation for details.
