  collaborations, etc.

The following types of organizations are generally eligible for significant
discounts on **Zulip Cloud Standard**.

  pricing](https://zulip.com/for/education/#feature-pricing).

- Discounts are available for organizations based in the **developing world**.

- Non-profits and other organizations where many users are **not paid staff**
  are generally eligible for a discount.

If there are any circumstances that make regular pricing unaffordable for your
organization, contact [sales@zulip.com](mailto:sales@zulip.com) to discuss your
situation.

### Education pricing

Educators using Zulip with students are eligible for discounted [education
pricing](https://zulip.com/for/education/#feature-pricing). Other educational
uses (e.g., by teaching staff or university IT) may qualify for a non-profit
discount instead.

!!! tip ""
    Organizations operated by individual educators (for example, a professor
    teaching one or more classes) usually find that the [Zulip Cloud Free
    plan](https://zulip.com/plans/#cloud) suits their needs.


Non-profit educational pricing applies to online purchases with no additional
legal agreements, for use at registered non-profit institutions (e.g., colleges
and universities).

To arrange discounted pricing for your organization, please [apply for
sponosorship](#apply-for-sponsorship). Contact
[sales@zulip.com](mailto:sales@zulip.com) with any questions.


### Apply for sponsorship

Submit a sponsorship request to apply for a free or discounted **Zulip Cloud
Standard** plan. If you do not have a Zulip organization yet, contact

## Differences between Zulip Cloud plans

### How does having 10,000 messages of search history on Zulip Cloud Free work?

Only the most recent 10,000 messages can be viewed and searched on the Zulip
Cloud Free plan. Older messages are still stored and will become available
again if the organization is upgraded to **Zulip Cloud Standard**.

### Will you switch to limiting Zulip Cloud Free history to messages sent in the last 90 days (like Slack has)?

**No.** As discussed in [this blog
post](https://blog.zulip.com/2022/08/26/why-slacks-free-plan-change-is-causing-an-exodus/),
a time-based limit to message history is simply a bad model for a collaboration
tool.

{end_tabs}

## Temporary users and guests

### How will I be charged for temporary users (e.g., limited-time clients)?

Users [can be deactivated](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) any time.
Deactivating a user frees up their license for reuse.

### How are guest accounts billed? Is there special pricing?

For an organization with N other users, 5*N [guest users](/help/guest-users)
are included at no extra charge. After that, you will need to purchase an
extra license for every 5 additional guest users.
