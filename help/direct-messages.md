# Direct messages

**Direct messages (DMs)** are conversations with other users that happen outside
of a [channel](/help/introduction-to-channels). DMs work well for one-off messages,
usually with just one or two others.

If you find yourself frequently conversing with the same person or group, it
often works better to [create a private channel](/help/create-a-channel) for your
conversations. This lets you organize your discussion into topics, and add or
remove participants as needed.

## Access a DM

If using Zulip in a browser or desktop, there are several ways to access an existing DM conversation.

* Click on **Direct messages** near the top of the left sidebar to access
  recent DM conversations.

* Click on any user in the right sidebar.

* Start typing a user's name in the [search](/help/search-for-messages) bar.
  You'll be able to select DMs with that user.

* Open the compose box, and enter a list of users on the **To:**
  line. Type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> to open that conversation.
