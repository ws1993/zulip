# Link to a message or conversation

Zulip makes it easy to share links to messages, topics, and channels. You can
link from one Zulip [conversation](/help/reading-conversations) to another, or
share links to Zulip conversations in issue trackers, emails, or other external
tools.

## Link to a channel within Zulip

Channel links are automatically formatted as [#channel name]().

## Link to Zulip from anywhere

All URLs in Zulip are designed to be shareable.  Copying the URL from
the browser's address bar will work for all views, including searches.

### Get a link to a specific message

This copies to your clipboard a permanent link to the message,
displayed in its thread (i.e. topic view for messages in a channel).
Viewing a topic via a message link will never mark messages as read.

These links will still work even when the message is [moved to another
topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic) or
[channel](/help/move-content-to-another-channel), or if its [topic is
resolved](/help/resolve-a-topic). Zulip uses the same permanent link syntax when
[quoting a message](/help/quote-or-forward-a-message).

When you paste a message link into the compose box, it gets automatically
formatted to be easy to read:

```
#**channel name>topic name@message ID**
```

When you send your message, the link will appear as **#channel name>topic
name@ðŸ’¬**.
