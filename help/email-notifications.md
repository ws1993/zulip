# Email notifications

## Message notification emails

Zulip can be configured to send message notification emails for [DMs mentions,
and alerts](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications), as well as [channel
messages](/help/channel-notifications) and [followed
topics](/help/follow-a-topic#configure-notifications-for-followed-topics).

You will receive email notifications only for messages sent when you were not
[active](/help/status-and-availability#availability) on Zulip. Messages sent to
the same conversation within a [configurable time
period](#configure-delay-for-message-notification-emails) (e.g., a few minutes)
will be combined into a single email.

You can reply to Zulip messages by replying to message notification emails.

    To enable replies via email on a self-hosted server, the [incoming email
    gateway][incoming-email-gateway] must be configured by the system
    administrator.

### Configure triggers for message notification emails

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Toggle the checkboxes in the **Email** column of the **Notification
   triggers** table.

{end_tabs}

### Include organization name in subject line

You can configure whether the name of your Zulip organization is included in the
subject of message notification emails.

Zulip offers a convenient **Automatic** configuration option, which includes the
name of the organization in the subject only if you have accounts in multiple
Zulip Cloud organizations, or in multiple organizations on the same Zulip server.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Email message notifications**, configure
   **Include organization name in subject of message notification emails**.

{end_tabs}

### Configure delay for message notification emails

To reduce the number of emails you receive, Zulip
delays sending message notification emails for a configurable period
of time. The delay helps in a few ways:

* No email is sent if you return to Zulip and read the message before
  the email would go out.
* Edits made by the sender soon after sending a message will be
  reflected in the email.
* Multiple messages in the same Zulip [conversation](/help/reading-conversations)
  are combined into a single email. Different conversations will always be in
  separate emails, so that you can respond directly from your
  email.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Email message notifications**, select the desired time period from the
   **Delay before sending message notification emails** dropdown.

{end_tabs}

### Hide message content

For security or compliance reasons, you may want to hide the content of your
Zulip messages from your email. Organization administrators can do this at an
[organization-wide level](/help/hide-message-content-in-emails), but you can
also do this just for the messages you receive.

This setting also blocks message topics, channel names, and user names from
being sent through your email.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Email message notifications**, toggle
   **Include message content in message notification emails**.

{end_tabs}

## New login emails

By default, Zulip sends an email whenever you log in to Zulip. These emails
help you protect your account; if you see a login email at a time or from a
device you don't recognize, you should
[change your password](/help/change-your-password) right away.

In typical usage, these emails are sent infrequently, since all Zulip apps
(web, mobile, desktop, and terminal) keep you logged in to any organization
you've interacted with in the last 1-2 weeks.

However, there are situations (usually due to corporate security policy) in
which you may have to log in every day, and where getting login emails can
feel excessive.

### Disable new login emails

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Other emails**, toggle
   **Send email notifications for new logins to my account**.

{end_tabs}

## Low-traffic newsletter

{!cloud-only.md!}

Zulip sends out a low-traffic newsletter (expect 2-4 emails a year)
to Zulip Cloud users announcing major changes in Zulip.

### Managing your newsletter subscription

{start_tabs}

{tab|zulip-cloud}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Other emails**, toggle
   **Send me Zulip's low-traffic newsletter (a few emails a year)**.

{end_tabs}
