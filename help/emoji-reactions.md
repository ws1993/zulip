# Emoji reactions

Emoji reactions let you quickly respond to a message. For example, üëç is
commonly used to express agreement or confirm that you've [read the
message](/help/read-receipts). Any emoji can be used as a reaction, including
[custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji). Reactions appear at the bottom of the
message.
