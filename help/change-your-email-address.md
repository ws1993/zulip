# Change your email address

By default, anyone can change their email address at any time.

Organization administrators can
[restrict users to certain email domains](/help/restrict-account-creation#configuring-email-domain-restrictions), or
[prevent users from changing their email](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes).
