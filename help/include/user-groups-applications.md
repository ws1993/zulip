Groups provide an easy way to refer to multiple users at once. You can:

- [Mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) a group of users,
  [notifying](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) everyone in the group as if
  they were personally mentioned.
- Compose a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) to a user group. This
  automatically puts all the users in the group into the addressee field.
- Subscribe a user group to a channel. This individually subscribes all the users
  in the group.
