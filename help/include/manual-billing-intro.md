With manual license management, you choose and pay for a fixed number of
licenses, which limits the number of users in your organization.

- If the limit is reached, unlike [automatic license
  management](#how-does-automatic-license-management-work), new users
  cannot join and existing users cannot be reactivated until licenses
  are manually added (or freed up by [deactivating existing
  users](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user)).

- When you add a license for the current billing period, you will be
  charged only for the remaining part of the billing period.

- If you have an annual billing period, each month, you will see a
  single charge for all licenses added the previous month. If you have
  a monthly billing period, the charge for licenses added during the
  previous month will be combined with your monthly renewal charge.
