If you choose to pay via a bank transfer from a bank outside of the United
States, your payment will likely incur a transfer charge. When asked which side
will pay the transfer charge, please be sure to **select “OUR”** from the menu
of options. Otherwise, third party banking fees will be deducted from the amount
you transfer, and the resulting total will be insufficient to pay the full
amount of your invoice.
