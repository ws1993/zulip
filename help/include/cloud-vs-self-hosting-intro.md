Whether [signing up for Zulip Cloud](https://zulip.com/new/) or [self-hosting
Zulip](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/) is the right choice for you depends on
the needs of your organization.

If you arenâ€™t sure what you need, our high quality export and import tools
([cloud][export-cloud], [self-hosted][export-self-hosted]) ensure you can always
move from our hosting to yours (and back). No matter which option you go with,
free or heavily discounted pricing is available for most non-business uses.
