To get the full benefits of Zulip's topic model, when starting a new
conversation, you should start a new topic!

Starting a topic is like a lighter weight version of giving your email a subject.
Topic names should be brief but specific, for example:

* **Good topic names:** "question about topics", "welcome Anna Smith!", "issue #1234"
* **Not so good topic names:** "question", "hi", "help", "this topic is about
a question I have about topics"


Don't stress about making it perfect! The first 2-3 words that
come to mind are probably fine, and you can always [change it
later](/help/rename-a-topic).
