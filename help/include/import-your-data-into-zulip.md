To start using Zulip, you will need to choose between Zulip Cloud and
self-hosting Zulip. For a simple managed solution, with no setup or maintenance
overhead, you can [sign up](/new/) for Zulip Cloud with just a few clicks.
Alternatively, you can [self-host](/self-hosting/) your Zulip organization. See
