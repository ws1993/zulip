# Help center (beta) documentation

This directory is part of an ongoing migration project to convert our
help center documentation to use starlight and add search to the docs
at the same time.

The status of the project can be tracked at this umbrella issue:
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/30450

If you are a developer, you can refer to `/devtools` page on your zulip
installation to know what commands to use to run the project for
development.
